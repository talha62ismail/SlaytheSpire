### Game Overview
A smaller and simpler version of Slay the Spire with less features. 
There is going to be only one Act and also only one path to reach to the Boss. 
Act starts off, and player will enter into different levels turn by turn until it either dies or defeats the boss to win the game.
The player uses cards to defeat the enemy and playing a card costs energy, each turn the player gets 3 energies in total.
Relics and potions give special abilities to the player to enhance the gameplay.
### Cards
There will be two types of cards, **Attack** and **Skill**.
**Attack** will be used by the player to deal damage to the enemies.
**Skill** cards allow you to gain different things such as block or even draw cards.
